					<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">Research on evolutionary computation (EC) and Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms is active, and many effective methods have already been proposed. Furthermore, applied research using these methods to real-world problems is actively being conducted. Meanwhile, in recent years, there has been a common recognition of the importance of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Therefore, in order to promote the practical application of evolutionary computation and swarm intelligence algorithms more than ever before, there is a need for a place to discuss and examine research on new methods of EC and PSO algorithms that take SDGs into consideration. With this in mind, we would like to propose a "Special Session on Evolutionary Computation and Swarm Intelligence Algorithms Considering SDGs." Some of the methods proposed so far are already effective for SDGs. We believe that this special session will be an effective place to identify and organize effective methods for achieving these SDGs, and to consider future developments.</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The theme of this special session is to discuss and examine research on new methods of Evolutionary computation (EC) and Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms that take SDGs into consideration.</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The aim is to investigate in both the new theories and methods for evolutionary computation and swarm intelligence algorithms that are effective for SDGs, and the methods that take SDGs into account when applying previously proposed algorithms to practical problems. Also, among the methods proposed so far, we will identify methods that are effective for SDGs and consider future developments.</p>
